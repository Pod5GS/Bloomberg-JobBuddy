## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Began unpacking and defining our user(s), the problem and potential solutions  
 * Met with company advisor on Friday 9/1. Aligned on the vision for the project and expectations. Decided to hold weekly meetings at Bloomberg offices or via phone/Skype alternatively
 * Completed our initial view of the system diagram for the product and wedge.
 * Drafted team contract and aligned on expectations from each other and how we will operate as a team and chose facilitator role for the project

### Week ahead:
 * Align with Company Advisor on timing for weekly meetings and schedule cadence of meetings
 *  with Prof. Tapan Parikh, who expressed interest in our project
 * Further define the target (i.e. disadvantaged youth): who is our user, motivations and needs. Define how we will conduct user research to get direct insights
 * Define initial product construct/objective and potential tradeoffs to consider

### Risks:
 * Solution can be very large and many angles to approach it. There will be tradeoffs to make considering the timelines for final deliverable
