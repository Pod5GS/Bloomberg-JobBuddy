## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Finalized user survey for both "mentees" (here) and mentors (here). Started distributing the survey to get feedback from      actual users
 * Initiated collection of feedback on lo-fi demo (here)
 * Received feedback in our first crit session (here)
 * Build technical architecture diagram for discussion with Bloomberg technical team (here)
 * Built initial storyboard; after reviewing further results, will align storyboard to build UX

### Week ahead:
 * Review findings of user research/surveys
 * Finalize initial storyboard and UX
 * Update product narrative and deck

### Risks:
 * Need to get statical significant amount of respondents for the specific target of disadvantaged youth
