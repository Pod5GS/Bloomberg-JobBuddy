## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Reviewed Sprint feedback 
 * Developed survey for separate target users and started getting limited responses and feedback on the survey (we will share the survey with you Sachin/Chris shortly)
 * Aligned on a development process and weekly process to get better outcomes on a weekly basis (link here) 
 * Build initial architecture diagram (to be reviewed further this coming week). Link here
 * Met with Faculty advisor (Tapan Parikh) regarding the project. Suggested to look into apprenticeship model used in other countries 
 * Worked on personal and team goals

### Week ahead:
 * Reach broader audience for user research to get feedback on assumptions made so far
 * Continue outreach to individuals and organizations to conduct user research and go deeper on the pain points and solution to build
 * Continue to review and update architecture diagram  

### Risks:
 * Need to get statical significant amount of respondents and/or good level of expert feedback from user research to hone in on solution
