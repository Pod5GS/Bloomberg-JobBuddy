# #Status 2

## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Created and submitted team contract (i.e. set ground rules as a team)
 * Completed an initial product narrative with our current vision
 * Completed two set of product sketches for two specific user stories
 * Updated system diagram based on product sketches
 * Began research/outreach to organizations and schools to conduct user research
 * Sent CSP-EC agreements to company advisor to countersign
 * Team-member met informally with NGO for initial third-party feedback

### Week ahead:
 * Align with Company Advisor on timing for weekly meetings (potential meeting this week)
 * Continue further definition of the target, motivations and needs. Reach out to potential organizations/schools to conduct user research (ideally prior to Sprint but may have time constraints)
 * Meeting with Studio Advisor (9/14)
 * Meeting with Prof. Tapan Parikh, who expressed interest in our project (9/12)
 * Complete Sprint #1 on 9/14 and 9/15

### Risks:
 * May not be possible to conduct initial user research with target segment prior to Sprint #1 due to time constraint/access
