## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Simplified our product construct to focus on the mentorship opportunity for our target versus focus on online courses, due to crowded marketplace and lack of differentiation, among others
 * Defined further our technical architecture 
 * Completed Crit 2 and got great feedback from VC's and other industry leaders
 * Met with Studio Advisor and captured feedback (mainly around ensuring that the experience for mentors is made as simple as possible, based on user research findings)

### Week ahead:
 * Do user research on simplified product loop 
 * Start building user experience

### Risks:
 * Ensure simplification of product loop still provides significant benefits to our target user + provides an emotional connection to create stickiness
