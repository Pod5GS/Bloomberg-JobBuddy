## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Completed Sprint 2 further refining product narrative and building UX demo with Invision app
 * Built matching algorithm using wide FFM in the deep with "fake" data. Will initiate using real data using skills data from Bloomberg and publicly available information (e.g. LinkedIn) in the coming week
 * Started building html website with initial UX 

### Week ahead:
 * Continue refining narrative and how to best showcase this 
 * Refine UX based on feedback from user testing
 * Continue working on back-end and matching algorithm

### Risks:
 * Quite a large story to build and many features. May need to streamline the product loop and UX to ensure it can be successfully built and explained in Sprint 3
