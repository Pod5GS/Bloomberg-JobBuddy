## How Might We Challenge:
How might we help disadvantaged youth and young professionals gain skills required from organizations/companies to get a job?

### Week behind:
 * Simplified user experience to focus on mentoring instead of online courses
 * Defined a set of features and flow 
 * Completed initial UX of the product to use for research
 * Continued building matching algorithm (to include geography) as well as online video API for mentoring online 
 * Completed Scrum on technical architecture

### Week ahead:
 * Do user research on simplified product loop with user target and other students/mentors
 * Get feedback on UX from product advisor, Parson's faculty, etc.
 * Meeting with UX designer at Bloomberg on Friday 11/10
 * Continue to develop back-end to plan starting connecting back-end with front-end

### Risks:
 * Ensure simplification of product loop still provides significant benefits to our target user
 * Ensure UX provides the emotional connection that we want to portray with our target user
 * May be difficult to find a target user to film a video
